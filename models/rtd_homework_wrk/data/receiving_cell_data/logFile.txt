SP SP1[1] <rtd_homework_lib:receiving_cell:schematic>   freq=(6.7 GHz->11.1 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    Data in the Touchstone file `C:/murenkov/rtd_homework_wrk/data/components/mfilter/s2p/mfilter.s2p'
    does not cover the requested value of `freq'.
    Therefore, the required data was obtained by extrapolation.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    Noise data in the Touchstone file `C:/murenkov/rtd_homework_wrk/data/components/mfilter/s2p/mfilter.s2p'
    does not cover the current value of `freq'. Therefore, if noise
    simulation is requested the data will be obtained by extrapolation.
